                <h2>DRESS CODE </h2>
                    <p>"The greatest lesson learned as an Event Producer is the ability to transform an occasion into a narrative with themes, 
                        costumes, and lifelong memories. The dress code is an essential part of creating something unique and exclusive. 
                        Black tie with Tropical Inspirations was my choice so that all guests could elevate their creative side, step out of their 
                        comfort zone, and transform the atmosphere into a unique moment on a glamorous night in the tropical winter in Rio de Janeiro."

                        it’s producing the main event on Saturday, May 30th. A selection of four-star hotels in the Ipanema neighborhood 
                        (near the event) is also part of our selection for a democratic portfolio.”<br> - <b>Tiago Mazzotti</b></p>

        <h1>IMPORTANT SAFETY TIPS</h1>
        <p><b>Rio de Janeiro is the second-most-populous city in Brazil, known for its stunning natural setting, vibrant culture and iconic landmarks. It’s extremely important to adapt your travel awareness due to its complex socio-economic contrast and safe district boundaries.</b></p>
        <p><br>The map below indicates the safest neighborhoods designed to keep tourists and locals away from high-crime-rated urban areas.  <b>Ipanema, Copacabana, Leblon, Leme, Sugar Loaf,</b> and <b>Christ the Redeemer</b> are places well supervised by the local police enforcement. Please stay within the highlighted zone for your comfort and safety.</p>

        <h3>Petty theft and pickpocketing can still happen but are less likely when visitor adapt their daily tourist activities with the following five important safety tips:</h3>
            <list>
                <li>Avoid all jewelry, watches and expensive personal items when visiting public places or the beach.</li><br>
                <li>Keep your cell phone always in your front pocket when visiting public places or the beach. It’s ok to take pictures, but stay alert while using your device in public open areas (except landmarks where safety is well enforced). Professional cameras are welcome at landmarks.</li><br>
                <li>Your state I.D, credit card and some change in reais (local currency) are enough when visiting public areas. Keep your wallet, multiple cards and passport in your safe at the hotel. Most places and street vendors are cashless.</li><br>
                <li>Do not use public transportation. Uber and taxi are extremely cheap in Brazil and available everywhere. Please make sure to turn on your PIN verification before starting your ride.</li><br>
                <li>Keep your daily fashion casual, simple and neutral when visiting public areas.</li>
