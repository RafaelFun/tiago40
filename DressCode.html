                        it’s producing the main event on Saturday, May 30th. A selection of four-star hotels in the Ipanema neighborhood 
                        (near the event) is also part of our selection for a democratic portfolio.”<br> - <b>Tiago Mazzotti</b></p>

        <p>Tropical inspirations in black tie format help adapt this famous dress code to the climate of Rio de Janeiro and,

        aesthetic. Original accessories, colorful patterns, unique prints and endless sparkles are welcome and highly appreciated.
