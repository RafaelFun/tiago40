                    <h2>DRESS CODE </h2>
                    <p>“"The greatest lesson learned as an Event Producer is the ability to transform an occasion into a narrative with themes, 
                        costumes, and lifelong memories. The dress code is an essential part of creating something unique and exclusive. 
                        Black tie with Tropical Inspirations was my choice so that all guests could elevate their creative side, step out of their 
                        comfort zone, and transform the atmosphere into a unique moment on a glamorous night in the tropical winter in Rio de Janeiro."

                        with exclusive discounts for my guests. The Fairmont Rio hotel offers the biggest discount because 
                        it’s producing the main event on Saturday, May 30th. A selection of four-star hotels in the Ipanema neighborhood 
                        (near the event) is also part of our selection for a democratic portfolio.”<br> - <b>Tiago Mazzotti</b></p>

            effective and safe travel planning during my 40th Birthday Celebrations in the wonderful city of Rio de Janeiro! Whether you

        <h2>ABOUT RIO</h2>
        <p>The city of Rio de Janeiro was chosen for this celebration because it has been Brazil’s most popular destination for centuries. 
            Many of our guests will have the privilege of experiencing Brazil for the first time. Rio represents Brazilian diversity, featuring 
            natural beauty, music, cuisine, culture, and global recognition through famous Hollywood films and international attractions. 
            It draws thousands of spectators to Copacabana Beach each year. Demand for Rio reached unprecedented levels in 2024 and 2025, with the city 
            recording its highest-ever number of foreign visitors. We acknowledge the security challenges Brazil has faced in recent decades, and we have 
            planned everything to ensure a positive experience, including a comprehensive security and comfort plan for all guests.
