                        costumes, and lifelong memories. The dress code is an essential part of creating something unique and exclusive. 
                        Black tie with Tropical Inspirations was my choice so that all guests could elevate their creative side, step out of their 
                        comfort zone, and transform the atmosphere into a unique moment on a glamorous night in the tropical winter in Rio de Janeiro."</i>
