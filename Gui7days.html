                    <h2>DRESS CODE </h2>
                    <p>“"The greatest lesson learned as an Event Producer is the ability to transform an occasion into a narrative with themes, 
                        costumes, and lifelong memories. The dress code is an essential part of creating something unique and exclusive. 
                        Black tie with Tropical Inspirations was my choice so that all guests could elevate their creative side, step out of their 
                        comfort zone, and transform the atmosphere into a unique moment on a glamorous night in the tropical winter in Rio de Janeiro."

                    <p>"The Travel Kit was designed to help everyone plan their trip to Rio de Janeiro effectively, 
                        with exclusive discounts for my guests. The Fairmont Rio hotel offers the biggest discount because 
                        it’s producing the main event on Saturday, May 30th. A selection of four-star hotels in the Ipanema neighborhood 
                        (near the event) is also part of our selection for a democratic portfolio.”<br> - <b>Tiago Mazzotti</b></p>
